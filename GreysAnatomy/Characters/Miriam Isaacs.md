#Neuro

- English
- Age 30 at the beginning of S1
- Came to [[Seattle Grace]] 2 years before [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[Calliope Torres]] despite being the same age 
	- Friends with both
	- Starts season 1 as a fellow specialising in neuro

#### Early Life
- Grew up extremely wealthy (old money)
- Is the eldest of 3
	- [[Christian Isaacs]] - younger brother a year and a half younger than Miriam
	- [[Freya Isaacs]] - Younger sister (youngest) 3 years younger than Miriam
- Mother ([[Clara Isaacs]]) died due to complications from Freya's birth
- Raised by her Dad([[Michael Isaacs]]) and her paternal Aunt([[Felicity Lloyd]])
- Childhood was happy
	- Miriam didn't notice how distant and absent her farther was becoming after the death of her mother.
	- Felicity provided a much needed maternal figure since Clara's death but 
- Attended boarding school at Cheltenham Ladies College
	- Mostly fine if uneventful, had friends didn't particularly get bullied
		- Miriam was not one of the most popular girls but was generally well liked
		- Miriam excelled in school and was given the opportunity to take her GCSEs a year early alongside her AS-levels, allowing her to complete her A-levels as the rest of her year was taking their GCSEs 
	- Miriam never got into the drinking/drug culture that was becoming increasingly common among her peers many of whom had some sort of mental health problem (mostly abandonment issues)
	- in the last 2 years of secondary school her best friend([[Phoebe Cole]]) gradually got into recreational drugs
		- Miriam was very concerned for her friend and consistently tried to help her and cautioned her about how dangerous this behaviour was
		- Phoebe didn't want to be helped and their friendship started to have major issues.
		- Everything came to a head when Miriam finds out that Phoebe had been taking Freya with her to the parties she snuck out to
			- Miriam found out after Freya had come to her in tears after being assaulted at one of them
				- This happened just after Miriam had finished her A-levels and had technically graduated
#### Uni and Med School
- Miriam attended Harvard Pre-Med when she was 16
	- After everything with Freya and Phoebe she felt an immense amount of guilt and like she'd failed to protect her little sister.
		- Freya had begun having panic attacks, night terrors, etc. since the assault
		- As Miriam was the one to help and comfort her straight after the event she had become one of Freya's triggers
	- This prompted Miriam to go further afield for university and medical school
	- At Harvard she threw herself into her studies to distract from her own trauma and graduated pre-med and med school at the top of her class. 
- Miriam met [[Mark Sloan]], [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Addison Montgomery]] during her 12 month Clinical Experience Phase
	- Gains an interest in neuro thanks to Derek
	- Has a fling with Mark
		- Miriam got a little too emotionally invested as she was still fairly new to dating
			- They had agreed to no strings attached but as always strings happened anyway
		- Addison warned her not to get too attached and that Mark wouldn't be exclusive
		- A part of Miriam expected exclusivity anyway, especially as they began going on proper dates
		- When the end of Miriam's CPE approached and she was matched to Seattle Grace she saw Mark blatantly coming out of a supply closet with another woman
			- The fling ended shortly after
		- Miriam initially felt very down about the experience (as if Mark had cheated on her) but chalked it up to a life lesson
			- She doesn't bear Mark any hard feelings

#### Pre Season 1
- Miriam does her residency at [[Seattle Grace]] after Derek recommended [[Richard Webber]] and his mentorship
- She doesn't become chief resident
	- She refused to apply given how much time the admin work would have taken from surgery
- Miriam falls in love with neuro and chooses the specialty at the end of her residency


#### Financial and Living arrangement

- Lives in an apartment in a building she owns([[Miriam's Building]])
- Doesn't care what salary she's on, she doesn't need it
- Generally keeps her financial means under-wraps and just lets people assume that she is well off due to being a neuro surgeon
