- Down the street from Joe's and also opposite [[Seattle Grace]]
- Originally an old warehouse built in the early 1900s
- Miriam bought it in her third year of residency
	- She purchased it from a former patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest due to the stress of trying to fund the repairs and upgrades the building needed
		- He had purchased it as a disused warehouse with the idea of converting it into an apartment building but had underestimated how much work it needed
		- He had already gotten most of the planning/zoning permissions sorted
	- She paid more than it was worth so that she could include the planning/zoning work that the seller had already done
- After buying it she didn't move in for another year while she got the entire building renovated
	- First she had the basement expanded into a full parking garage
	- The building has 5 floors and each from the 2nd floor up was converted into a single apartment (4 apartments total)
		- The building is big enough that each floor can accommodate:
			- Large Kitchen with pantry
			- Large Lounge
			- 3 good sized bedrooms
			- A large master bedroom with a walk-in closet and an en-suite
			- 2 bathrooms
			- laundry/utility room
		- Miriam took the top floor for herself and converted the attic to be an office, a reading room which she filled with plants and a third room she uses for storage
			- She had the south side of the roof in the attic replaced with windows
- The building also has a communal garden and a large elevator (formerly the freight elevator)
- Miriam gifted the apartment under hers to [[Freya Isaacs]] and plans to sell the remaining 2 to people she likes
	- She had offered them to [[Calliope Torres]] and [[Miranda Bailey]] but neither accepted
		- Bailey was set on her current home which was located in a middle ground between [[Seattle Grace]] and her husband's work
		- Callie was happy in an apartment her dad got her and didn't think she had time to move
- Miriam employs a dedicated cleaning and housekeeping service for the whole building
	- they keep her plants healthy and go into the 2 unoccupied regularly to check them
