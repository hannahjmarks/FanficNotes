#Psych

#### Early Life

- Freya felt very abandoned by [[Michael Isaacs]]
- [[Miriam Isaacs]] became more than an older sister to her, she was also a surrogate mother and [[Christian Isaacs]] doted on her
- When each of her siblings went off to boarding school she felt completely alone and her already present abandonment issues grew deeper

#### Cheltenham Ladies College

- By the time Freya joined Miriam at CLC she was ecstatic, they were in the same house which meant that the pair were able to spend a lot of time together
- Freya idolised Miriam and as a result began idolising Miriam's friends too, especially the charismatic [[Phoebe Cole]]
- As Miriam's course-load got heavier and she had less free time Freya began hanging around with Phoebe more often
	- Phoebe eventually introduced her to some of her other friends and while Freya refused the substances they offered (including alcohol) she quickly became desperate for their approval and friendship
- Freya developed early (physically) and thus Phoebe brought her with her to one of the parties she liked to sneak out to
	- At 13 Freya was by far the youngest person at the party and soon got separated from Phoebe and gained the attention of an older boy she didn't know
	- Freya did nothing to encourage his attention and when she tried to go to find Phoebe he got angry
	- He was much larger and stronger than she was and pulled her into an unoccupied room where he sexually assaulted her
	- Freya ran when he finally let her go and went straight to Miriam

#### After leaving CLC and Pre Season 1

- Freya was deeply traumatised by the assault and was home schooled after it
	- Became much closer with [[Michael Isaacs]]
	- Began therapy
	- Misses [[Miriam Isaacs]] terribly but seeing her is a trigger as it reminds her of the night of her assault
	- Takes an interest in art history while getting closer to her dad
- Decides to study psychiatry to become a therapist to help children who've gone through things like she has
	- Goes to University of Washington and technically stays in the dorms but visits/stays over at Miriam's all the time
		- Has her own apartment in [[Miriam's Building]]
	- Is planning to join the Seattle Grace residency program in the Psychiatry department.
	- Has her own college friends but also likes [[Miranda Bailey]] and [[Calliope Torres]]
