##### [[Evelyn Dashwood]]
Sees her as an ally in family matters, especially those where their mother and younger sisters would allow themselves to be swept away by fancy. Often feels as though Evelyn is the only one among her family who understands that her feelings are just as deep as everyone else's and that she simply prefers to keep them private.

Initially pities him for his unrequited affection towards Marianne whilst being irritated that said affection seems to have blinded him to Evelyn. Much happier when he begins to take interest in Evelyn. Otherwise same as book.
