#Protagonist #Dashwood #Sense

#### Personality 
- Reserved/Private
- Thoughtful
- practical
- Witty/playful when in trusted company
- Observant

#### Appearance
- Light Skin
- Light Blonde Hair
- Pale Blue Eyes
- Regular (Symmetrical) features
- Slender, delicate figure (doesn't fit regency standards)
- Lips are full and a little too naturally red for the beauty standards of the time
	- This is one of the reasons why she is quiet or shy around unfamiliar company as in the past people have assumed she was wearing makeup/rouge in order to attract men, a practice only the elderly or prostitutes engaged in.

While beautiful, her appearance is considered unconventional which puts Evelyn squarely in the striking camp and is often the source of ridicule when dealing with other women her own age.

#### Interests
- Music (pianoforte, violin and cello)
- Shooting (Guns and Archery)
- Nature/Gardening
- Chess
- Reading

#### Relationships

##### [[John & Fanny Dashwood]]
Dislikes the couple, sees Fanny's greed and John's cowardice in the face of his wife's opinion. She also witnessed far more of Fanny's controlling behaviour and superiority than the rest of her family during her stay with them in London (prior to book start).

##### [[Henry Dashwood]]
Loved her father and was much closer to him than she was her mother as Henry appreciated both Elinor and Evelyn's more reserved nature that likely came from his own. When she showed an interest in shooting Henry began teaching her Archery and only when she had mastered that to his standard did he begin teaching her proper shooting and gun care. Before his death they would go hunting together.

##### [[Mrs Dashwood - Mama]]
Loves her mother but sometimes feels that she disappoints her mother who favours both Marianne and Margaret her more outgoing and emotional children. Additionally, her mother finds most of her interests to be too masculine and tries to encourage Evelyn to pursue her more conventional interests instead. Even though Evelyn knows that her mother's attitude towards her hobbies is born from a worry at her prospects and stability in life she can't help but feel that her mother wishes she were different.

##### [[John Willoughby]]
Greatly dislikes Willoughby. When they first meet she simply finds his confidence a little intimidating but later after Willoughby begins making cruel and disparaging remarks about the Colonel she actively avoids the man. This puts a strain on her and Marianne's relationship when her sister begins to mimic Willoughby's less favourable traits. She outright despises the man after he leaves Marianne heartbroken.

##### [[Lucy Steele]]
Finds her off-putting initially likely due to the ease with which Lucy approached her and Elinor but gradually warms to her until Elinor tells her of the conversation regarding Edward. After this Evelyn notices that Lucy tends to seek Elinor out to talk about Edward and there is a certain malicious glee in her expression when she does. At this point Evelyn makes a concerted effort to shield Elinor and finally deals with Lucy by suggesting she should get closer to Fanny if they are to be sisters.

##### [[Mrs Jennings]]
Finds her overwhelming to start but quickly warms to the woman despite her picking and prodding as she can see that there is only genuine curiosity behind it, no malice. After she and the Colonel are engaged Evelyn goes to Mrs Jennings at ask for advice on how to play matchmaker between Marianne and Roger.

##### [[Sir John Middleton]]
Much like Mrs Jennings, Evelyn is overwhelmed by Sir John at first but similarly finds him pleasant company after a short time. They find that they share a love of shooting and he invites her to hunt with himself and the Colonel

##### [[Edward Ferrars]]
Likes Edward immediately when his shy demeanour seems similar to her own. Is very happy that he and Elinor seem so infatuated with one an other and is hopeful that he would propose to Elinor. When Edward fails to visit them at Barton Cottage her opinion of him sours at Elinor's clear heartbreak. It's only later when Lucy reveals her attachment to Edward that she gains some clarity which initially sour her opinion further as he had led Elinor on knowing of his engagement. When she realises the kind of person Lucy is however she understands that Edward's feelings for Elinor were in fact earnest and that he was the one who was taken advantage of. She later asks the Colonel for a wedding present in the form of a clergy position for Edward so that he and Elinor might have a chance at happiness.

##### [[Roger Dalton]]
Evelyn originally met Roger in her first and rather disastrous season in London when he proved himself to be a kind man with a gentlemanly disposition. They met when he witnessed Evelyn duck out of a ball after being mocked by some of the other ladies. He was by far the highlight of Evelyn's season but sadly he believed himself in love and was engaged, dashing Evelyn's hopes for a possible courtship. When Evelyn returns to London, this time with Mrs Jennings the rest of their party, she runs into Roger during a walk through Hyde park. She is surprised to learn that he is not married despite being engaged only a year prior and this time she is the one in love (and soon to be engaged). Evelyn introduces Roger to her sisters on a rare day when she manages to get Marianne out of the house. Evelyn is delighted when Marianne seems to warm to Roger's good-willed and playful nature despite still yearning for Willoughby. Evelyn invites Roger to her and the Colonel's wedding in hopes that he and Marianne will be able to spend time together.

##### [[Margaret Dashwood]]
Loves Margaret dearly and is often the sister who spends the most time with her as they both enjoyed learning archery from their father, much to their mother's displeasure. After they settle in Barton Cottage Evelyn sets up a small archery range behind the garden and promises to finish teaching Margaret Archery in place of their father. Margaret often seeks out Evelyn's company as she is the only one of their sisters who will play with her.

##### [[Marianne Dashwood]]
Evelyn loves Marianne as she loves all her sisters but is aware that her relationship with Marianne is the most volatile among them, mostly due to Marianne's own nature. Growing up they often enjoyed practicing and playing music with each other. Originally Evelyn favoured the pianoforte but when Marianne fell in love with the instrument and practically glued herself to the seat she moved on to the violin and the cello. Evelyn is slightly jealous of Marianne in that she is able to openly display her emotions without fear to even strangers. After the death of their father Marianne and Evelyn develop a kinship in trading witty remarks about John & Fanny (when out of earshot of Elinor). Her jealousy reaches its peak when they meet Colonel Brandon and he takes immediate interest in Marianne but doesn't show outwardly until Evelyn reprimands Marianne for the comments she and Willoughby made about the Colonel. At this point Evelyn feels that Marianne can be selfish and that her previous wit had taken on a crueller edge since meeting Willoughby. Regardless of this, when Willoughby abandons Marianne Evelyn consoles her alongside Elinor. Later when in London Evelyn introduces Marianne to Roger.

##### [[Elinor Dashwood]]
Out of all of her family Evelyn is closest to Elinor. They share many personality traits and as such are the only ones who notice the full extent of the others emotions. They also share the emotional and practical burdens the rest of their family tend to leave to them, allowing each of them some much needed breathing room. Evelyn and Elinor do their best to support one another even though Elinor believes (like their mother) that many of Evelyn's more masculine hobbies will make finding a good match all the more difficult.

##### [[Colonel Brandon]]
The Colonel is one of the few people whom Evelyn takes an instant liking to, sensing the same kind of kinship she feels with Elinor, as the enamoured look on his face at the first sight of Marianne and his later stiffness and grave countenance suggest that the man has the same trouble expressing himself as Evelyn. Evelyn gradually develops feelings for the man when hunting with both the Colonel and Sir John. When the Colonel visits Barton Cottage after Marianne injured her ankle Evelyn learns that the Colonel has a Hot House at his estate and can't help asking the Colonel about it and accepts his invitation to visit it, though the invitation seemed to have been extended out of reflex. When Evelyn visits Delaford with Elinor she learns that she and the Colonel share a love of Shakespeare (particularly Hamlet). After this the Colonel extends an invitation to Evelyn to visit Delaford regularly under the guise of advising him regarding some of his rarer plants. Over these visits, now without a chaperone, Evelyn's feelings grow but she believes them to be unrequited, thinking that the Colonel's affection still lies with her sister. With the Colonel's sudden departure to London Evelyn finds herself adrift until Mrs Jennings invites the 3 eldest Dashwood's to her townhouse in London. The Colonel's visit to warn them about Willoughby further solidifies Evelyn's fears that the Colonel is in love with Marianne but is largely able to hide her broken heart from all but Elinor. She finally feels a spark of hope when the Colonel attends
