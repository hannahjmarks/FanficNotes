#### Early Life/Origins
- Daughter of an English naval officer, [[Johnathan West]], and a Spanish woman of lesser nobility, [[Helena Cantero]]
	- Parents had a whirlwind romance that was mostly fuelled by their young ages and the forbidden nature of the relationship
- Helena fell pregnant and the two eloped shortly before absconding to England after Helena's father tried to kill Johnathan for sullying his daughter
- Johnathan left the navy after marrying Helena and returned to his home where his family found his wife's nationality to be too much of a scandal and disowned Johnathan
	- The couple quickly found themselves destitute once Johnathan's navy wages stopped
	- They moved to London where Johnathan was able to find work as a Carpenter (his original naval position)
		- Johnathan was a skilled craftsman and was able to earn a decent wage by making the more elaborate decorative aspects of some of the more ambitious naval ships
- Helena found her new circumstances to be jarring at first but was still caught up in the fanciful idea that she and Johnathan would succeed so long as they were together.
- Johnathan died after a large timber fell on him at the shipyard.
	- the rigging broke, it was an accident, no foul play
- Helena was left widowed in a foreign country with a 3 year old daughter to care for.
	- She tried to find work to support the pair of them but everything she got either exploited her or didn't last due to tensions between the Spanish and British Empires increasing and her obvious Spanish decent.
- Helena eventually succumbed to working in [[The Gilded Menagerie]], one of London's more well known brothels
	- The Menagerie was famous for having at least one girl from almost every country in the known world
- Alicia grew up at the Menagerie and was at first cared for by Helena but as the years passed Helena became more and more angry and depressed
	- Helena began drinking when Alicia was 6 and began blaming Alicia for all her woes
		- [[The Madam]] started to look after Alicia with the few other children from the courtesans when Alicia was 7
- Alicia was always known to be an odd child, often appearing moments before someone called for her or carrying out someone's instructions before they voiced them
	- The Madam was the one who decided to test Alicia's peculiarity and was the one to determine that she was psychic
- From then on The Madam began teaching Alicia elocution, though not in the traditional sense
	- She had Alicia learn not only how to speak in a manner befitting the English upper class but also had her learn to mimic the accents of the various European courtesans, eventually telling her that it was so that she would be able to adapt and act the part of The Menagerie's fortune teller when she got older
- Alicia first started reading fortunes at The Menagerie when she was 13
	- She quickly became popular and The Madam started allowing guests in to see her during the daytime when The Menagerie had more polite entertainment for the nobility
		- This is how she met [[Lady Lucille Bainbridge]]
- When she turned 15 The Madam began training Alicia in the ways of a courtesan
	- Alicia realised that it was not a life she wanted and began looking for a way out
- Lady Bainbridge became her salvation when she offered to buy Alicia from The Madam
	- Helena didn't protest
	- Lady Bainbridge had been visiting Alicia for readings almost daily and had decided to see if she could have Alicia as her personal Seer.
- After the death of her husband Lady Bainbridge decided she wished to leave the drear of London and move to warmer climates, thus departing for [[Port Royal]], Alicia in tow (Alicia was 19)
- Lady Bainbridge succumbed to fever two and a half years after the pair settled in Port Royal
	- By then Alicia had established herself as Madame Seraphina in Port Royal and thanks to some money left to her by Lady Bainbridge she was able to open her own 'Shop'
- From then on Alicia's clientele became far more varied
	- some of the upper class had her make house calls or act as a novel form of entertainment at balls
	- the middle class which were mostly naval officers came in 2 types, those who wanted to know how they should bet and the earnest ones who wanted to know what the safest route on their upcoming journeys
	- she rarely got visits from the lower class as most couldn't afford to waste money on such things and knew that so long as they didn't get too entitled she would probably tell them the important things anyway

- Mid twenties at the beginning of black pearl
	- a few years older than [[Elizabeth Swann]]
	- a few years younger than [[James Norrington]]
- Lives in port royal as a fortune teller/psychic
	- Stage name is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Madame Seraphina</mark>
	- came to port royal after becoming the private seer of [[Lady Lucille Bainbridge]] whom she met in London when she was only 13 and working as a fortune teller in a brothel.
