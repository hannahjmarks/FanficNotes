#### Early Life/Origins
- Daughter of an English naval officer, [[Johnathan West]], and a Spanish woman of lesser nobility, [[Helena Cantero]]
	- Parents had a whirlwind romance that was mostly fuelled by their young ages and the forbidden nature of the relationship
- Helena fell pregnant and the two eloped shortly before absconding to England after Helena's father tried to kill Johnathan for sullying his daughter
- Johnathan left the navy after marrying Helena and returned to his home where his family found his wife's nationality to be too much of a scandal and disowned Johnathan
	- The couple quickly found themselves destitute once Johnathan's navy wages stopped
	- They moved to London where Johnathan was able to find work as a Carpenter (his original naval position)
		- Johnathan was a skilled craftsman and was able to earn a decent wage by making the more elaborate decorative aspects of some of the more ambitious naval ships
- Helena found her new circumstances to be jarring at first but was still caught up in the fanciful idea that she and Johnathan would succeed so long as they were together.
- Johnathan died after a large timber fell on him at the shipyard.
	- the rigging broke, it was an accident, no foul play
- Helena was left widowed in a foreign country with a 3 year old daughter to care for.
	- She tried to find work to support the pair of them but everything she got either exploited her or didn't last due to tensions between the Spanish and British Empires increasing and her obvious Spanish decent.

#### Living at the Menagerie

- Helena eventually succumbed to working in [[The Gilded Menagerie]], one of London's more well known brothels
	- The Menagerie was famous for having at least one girl from almost every country in the known world
- Elia grew up at the Menagerie and was at first cared for by Helena but as the years passed Helena became more and more angry and depressed
	- Helena began drinking when Elia was 6 and began blaming Elia for all her woes
		- [[The Madam]] started to look after Elia with the few other children from the courtesans when Elia was 7
- Elia was always known to be an odd child, often appearing moments before someone called for her or carrying out someone's instructions before they voiced them
	- The Madam was the one who decided to test Elia's peculiarity and was the one to determine that she was psychic
- From then on The Madam began teaching Elia elocution, though not in the traditional sense
	- She had Elia learn not only how to speak in a manner befitting the English upper class but also had her learn to mimic the accents of the various European courtesans, eventually telling her that it was so that she would be able to adapt and act the part of The Menagerie's fortune teller when she got older
- Elia first started reading fortunes at The Menagerie when she was 13
	- She quickly became popular and The Madam started allowing guests in to see her during the daytime when The Menagerie had more polite entertainment for the nobility
		- This is how she met [[Lady Lucille Bainbridge]]
- When she turned 15 The Madam began training Elia in the ways of a courtesan
	- Elia realised that it was not a life she wanted and began looking for a way out
- Lady Bainbridge became her salvation when she offered to buy Elia from The Madam
	- Helena didn't protest
	- Lady Bainbridge had been visiting Elia for readings almost daily and had decided to see if she could have Elia as her personal Seer.

#### Port Royal

- After the death of her husband Lady Bainbridge decided she wished to leave the drear of London and move to warmer climates, thus departing for [[Port Royal]], Elia in tow (Elia was 19)
- Lady Bainbridge succumbed to fever two and a half years after the pair settled in Port Royal
	- By then Elia had established herself as Madame Seraphina in Port Royal and thanks to some money left to her by Lady Bainbridge she was able to open her own 'Shop'
- From then on Elia's clientele became far more varied
	- some of the upper class had her make house calls or act as a novel form of entertainment at balls
	- the middle class which were mostly naval officers came in 2 types, those who wanted to know how they should bet and the earnest ones who wanted to know what the safest route on their upcoming journeys
	- she rarely got visits from the lower class as most couldn't afford to waste money on such things and knew that so long as they didn't get too entitled she would probably tell them the important things anyway


#### James Norrington

- First met [[James Norrington]] at a ball Lady Bainbridge held shortly after her arrival to Port Royal.
	-  James was sceptical at best of Elia (though he only knew her as Madame Seraphina) and essentially viewed her as a con artist
- When Elia opened her shop after Lady Bainbridge's death James paid her a visit to demand that she turn away the navy men who had begun visiting her
	- His demands were basically that she not encourage them to be more superstitious than they already were
	- Elia of course refused and couldn't help herself but to flirt with the handsome young captain, something which caught James off guard
- In the time leading up to the beginning of Black Pearl James continued to run into Elia though her appearance at the high society soirees was less frequent he still paid visits to her shop in an effort to discourage her from accepting the navy men as clients
	- In reality he has an ulterior motive, he both enjoys her company (including the witty flirting) and is concerned for her living alone as an unmarried woman

#### Abilities

- Elia is effectively a psychic, her specific abilities are:
	- Locating people/objects
		- to find people she requires an object of significant sentimental value to the target or at the very least something they have physically handled enough to have left a sort of psychic signature
		- objects are more difficult and she is really only able to find things of significant sentimental value to the person she is reading, physical contact with the person is required.
			- She occasionally gets asked to find the belongings of the deceased, this is not something she can do unless there is someone alive who also has an attachment to the item
	- Reading someone's future
		- she uses Tarot in her shop but in reality they're little more than props for her
		- she is able to see brief glimpses into a person's immediate future
			- the closer she is with a person the clearer the vision and the further she can see into their future.
				- She is also more likely to get random visions into the futures of those she's closest to, mostly in the form of dreams
			- The more dire a future is the more insistent a vision will be with someone Elia cares for
	- Reading intentions
		- Elia is able to get a cursory read of another's intentions when she is within around 20ft of them
			- the closer they are the more accurate she is
			- she has leveraged this ability when defending herself before but found out the hard way that any more than 2 opponents renders the ability more of a distraction than anything
		- In crowds this ability is utterly overwhelming and so she doesn't dare use it in such settings

#### Limitations - Abilities
- Elia is not able to contact or commune with the dead in any way
- when locating a person if she keeps using her ability with one single item then she risks muddling the psychic signature of the target with her own
- reading the intentions of any more than 2 people at once is too much information to process
- trying to push too far into someone's future is extremely taxing and can eventually cause damage if she goes too far

#### Looking into her own future

- While Elia is able to look into her own future there are 2 main reasons why she doesn't
	- when she does they tend to drift and change as her decisions alter while she watches their outcomes, making the whole thing a confusing mess of images most of the time
- She spent time trying to do it properly while at The Menagerie and was relatively successful
	- She had met a young nobleman, [[Edward Wakefield]], who'd found himself in competition with the [[East India Trading Company]] and [[Cutler Beckett]] specifically.
	- After giving the man some helpful advice on the outcome of his latest idea to compete with the EITC he became a frequent visitor
	- Elia and Edward had a rapport that quickly grew into affection
	- Elia caught a glimpse of a future for Edward in which she was his wife and became somewhat obsessed with the idea
		- This was the incident that made Elia realise she didn't want to stay in The Menagerie for the rest of her life
	- Elia continued to help Edward and they eventually became enough of a problem for Beckett that he had Edward Killed
		- Elia had slipped away from The Menagerie for an evening with Edward and they were cornered by Mr Mercer and a few of Beckett's other men.
		- Elia tried to use her abilities to avoid the strikes of the men but there were too many and Edward threw himself in-front of what would have been a killing blow for Elia
		- Elia managed to escape in that moment back to The Menagerie and entered the employ of Lady Bainbridge less than a week later
			- Beckett left her alone after that incident, feeling that since Edward had been dealt with the real threat was removed
			- Elia remains terrified of Cutler Beckett

- Mid twenties at the beginning of black pearl
	- a few years older than [[Elizabeth Swann]]
	- a few years younger than [[James Norrington]]
- Lives in port royal as a fortune teller/psychic
	- Stage name is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Madame Seraphina</mark>
	- came to port royal after becoming the private seer of [[Lady Lucille Bainbridge]] whom she met in London when she was only 13 and working as a fortune teller in a brothel.
