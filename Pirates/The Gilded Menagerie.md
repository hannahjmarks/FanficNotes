One of the most famous brothels in London, The Gilded Menagerie, mostly known as just The Menagerie, caters to only the upper echelons of London society. During the day it's main stage is occupied by the various musical talents of the several courtesans who both live and work there. By night the main stage hosts a far more debauched set of performances.

The Menagerie's main draw is that it boasts at least one girl from almost every country in the known world and claimed to be able to satisfy even the most exotic of tastes.
