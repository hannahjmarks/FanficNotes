- Dani tries to engineer the situation but overestimates her abilities (arrogance) and the end goes out of control
- Happens over Dani's fourth year
- Dani contacts Moody about Torsten's suspicious behaviour from the summer between 3rd and 4th year
	- She tells him about how he seems to be trying to get Josephina to sign the family assets over to him
	- The real problem would come when Torsten realises that Josephina alone doesn't have the authority and that nothing would be possible without her signature or her death
- Moody begins putting covert tails on Torsten
	- A few of Torsten's attempts get thwarted this way and he becomes increasingly desperate
	- This happens over the first 2 terms of fourth year
- Dani gets emancipated over the easter break and what little progress Torsten had made goes up in smoke
	- Once Dani is emancipated she finally tells Calliope and her other friends about the state Josephina's actually in
- Torsten was caught in one of his less legal attempts and was forced to pay yet more fines
	- His father disowns him
	- Torsten is now basically penniless and very desperate
- Dani and Calliope spend time in muggle London over summer
	- Torsten spots Dani in the leaky cauldron as she's going to meet cally and follows her
- Torsten follows them until they go to a quieter part of the city and corners them in an alley.
	- Torsten attacks them and at first Dani uses magic in defence
		- She's trying to get the trace to trigger and alert someone at the ministry
			- unbeknownst to her, Moody has had her trace monitored since spring and responds
	- During the fight Torsten starts using the killing curse and Cally is in the line of fire
		- Dani can't block it but she barely manages to redirect it into the wall, saving cally
- Dani feels unbridled rage at Torsten attacking Cally and drains him
	- Cally sees everything and is understandably distraught 
		- She panics more at Dani's weird fugue state
	- Moody arrives while Dani is distracted with Cally
		- he sees the state of the body and immediately connects it with Levi's death
	- Dani (in fugue) vanishes the body and Torsten's wand when Moody says that he won't be able to stop others at the ministry connecting the dots as well
	- Moody gives Cally a calming draught, cleans her up and obliviates the memory of Torsten's death
		- He leaves the attack but changes the death and vanishing to Torsten's spell backfiring, obliterating his body and wand
- Moody takes the two girls to the auror's office where they give their statements and their spell history is checked and filed as evidence
	- Dani notices her fingers changing even while at the office
		- Her claws become a seamless part of her fingers and the white material they're made of extends almost to her wrists along where her bones lay, her palms are mostly normal if a little paler
		- Her Astral Vision also improves rapidly
			- She is better able to determine the exact nature of spells and enchantments
				- She's also faster, allowing her to determine what spells are being cast before they have chance to initiate
		- Her ambient sense and understanding of magic also improves
	- Moody tells Dani that he'll be by with Dumbledore the next day, to discuss what actually happened
- Once Dani and Cally are released they go home - the Green's try to invite Dani back to stay with them in case she doesn't feel safe but Dani refuses, saying that she'd feel better behind all the wards on the atelier
- The next day Moody arrives with not just Dumbledore but also Snape
	- They believe Dani is a carrier for the curse that killed Levi and thus brought Snape who's better with the Dark Arts
	- Dani confesses that it's an ability not a curse and that she lied to Moody the first time
		- They are all very taken aback that a ten year old killed her father
		- Dumbledore and Snape are both aware of Dani's Astral vision (though not the extent) and ask if this ability is linked.
	- After Snape questions what exactly she did to both Torsten and Levi Dani clams up and refuses to answer any more questions
- Dumbledore and Snape inform the necessary hogwarts staff of what happened and Cally and Dani have to undergo counselling when they come back for fifth year (mandatory once per month but they have an open invitation to any head of house if they need to talk)
	- Cally's is with Flitwick, Sprout or McGonagall (technically any head of house but she never goes to Snape)
		- Cally struggles with spellcasting in the immediate aftermath but gets over it
		- Cally really struggles with duelling and worries that something like Torsten's backfired spell could happen
			- Dani takes her to the room of requirement and helps her get past it
	- Dani mostly goes to Snape because he sits in silence, waiting for her to speak, which she doesn't
		- She mostly saves what little homework she has for these sessions
		- Dani occasionally has to go to one of the other heads due to scheduling, she hates it
			- Flitwick keeps trying to get her to 'open up' or tells her it's ok to cry
			- Sprout is very pragmatic and keeps telling Dani that she's not a murderer and that she was right to act in defence
			- McGonagall is irritatingly insightful and after the incident with Cally panicking at Dani's duel in Lockhart's duelling club she manages to get more out of Dani than the others
		- McGonagall relays the information to Snape who brings it up and pushes for more
			- Dani gets angry and argues back
			- During the argument Snape loosens his collar and Dani spots his soul mark
