	- there is no title it is more of a journal/almanac where previous family heads detailed important instructions for the current head
	- Written by [[Paimon Avery]] in 1856


An addition made by Paimon Avery, 1856

The following passage is of dire importance to the Avery family and should not be shared with outsiders besides trusted soulmates. I have spent the last years scraping together all I can on the Unbounds but sadly all our prior notes were destroyed by one of our predecessors. The following sections detail everything I was able to uncover. Should you be inclined to destroy my work out of fear like our ancestor did theirs then I can only implore you not to. Regardless of your feelings towards the Unbounds the information here should prove useful.

##### Identifying an Unbound

As the current head of the Avery family you should be well aware that some members of our family possess certain peculiar appearances. While tall frames and sharp features can be found in most of our members, claws and fangs are rarer and a tell-tale indicator of an Unbound. These identifiers will not appear until a Witch or Wizard has reached sufficient magical strength, usually around their magical maturity. Their soul mark should also appear around this time.

Their abilities manifest much earlier however. As soon as a child of our family begins actively using their magic, be that when they attend school or earlier, they should be asked if they noticed any changes with their vision when casting. If they respond in the affirmative then see the section below on the abilities of the unbound to verify.

Should an Unbound progress further than the initial stages of their development then their skin will become a white and hard, starting from the claws which will become a seamless part of the fingers. This hardened skin will also demonstrate some magic resistance, akin to dragon hide but to a lesser extent. In the last documented stage of an Unbound's progression they will have lost all pigmentation and their eyes will become pupilless, solid white. The overall effect has been likened to a marble statue. Should you ever have the misfortune of meeting an Unbound in this stage do not try to reason with it, you must destroy it as quickly as possible.
##### Unbounds in our History

In most cases Unbounds are not to be feared and are just as much a member of the family as everyone else. They have on numerous occasions proven to be our greatest asset. That said they also pose a great threat. Unbounds are not entirely human. The first to appear in our family was Antonius Avery and I suspect that his parentage is the root of the Unbounds. I do not know what Antonius' father was, and Cressida Avery (mother) cannot be considered a reliable source of information, but I believe it must have been something akin to a Veela if it was able to produce viable offspring with a human.

Due to an Unbound's profound magical abilities they have been some of our most insightful and potent spellcasters in our history. Many of our greatest accomplishments can be attributed to them as can some of our most despicable acts. An Unbound is, if nothing else, exceptionally powerful. Thus, should that power be in the hands of the wrong person it spells disaster. Please also be aware that even the sweetest of Unbounds are not to be trifled with, details below in the dangers of being unbound.

##### The Abilities of the Unbound

The first ability to manifest allows them to see magical potential, that is magical energy not yet formed into a spell, which I will henceforth refer to as Astral Vision. This also enhances their natural ability to interact with such magical potential, an ability inherent to all Witches and Wizards. The more adept Unbounds were able to leverage this ability in the creation of new spells and enchantments. 

Some Unbounds were reportedly able to bend the trajectory or target of spells fired by other Wizards, though I believe this proficiency had more to do with their duelling prowess than any improvement of their Astral Vision. The only other known ability of the Unbound is the power to drain something of its magic. The use of this ability on objects renders them inert and possibly broken depending on the enchantment taken. The use of this ability on a human can be catastrophic. Should the Unbound only partially drain another Wizard then said Wizard will simply feel very lethargic but will recover quickly and without issue. Draining a Wizard completely will always result in their death. The final stages of the draining process causes the victim's skin to  grey and their eyes to turn black before bursting in a spray of an as yet unidentified black liquid. This ability is only possible when the Unbound has direct physical contact with the source they are draining from.
##### The Dangers of Being an Unbound

The following section is section is based entirely on the notes I was able to recover detailing a set of experiments performed on an unnamed Unbound, they were incomplete and written by an observer. I do not believe there is a first hand account of the listed phenomena, if one existed previously it has been destroyed. Should this work ever fall into the hands of an Unbound I ask that you provide, in as much detail as possible, your experiences in this area. I also hope that you do not experience most of what is detailed here.

An Unbound's ability to drain magic can be a great boon but I'm afraid it has one unimaginable cost. When an Unbound absorbs enough magic to strengthen their own core they lose some of their humanity. In the experimentation notes I uncovered, the Unbound test subject became colder and more unfeeling the more they absorbed. The test subject eventually lost all forms of conscience and most emotions, the only thing the seemed to desire was absorbing more magic still. It is unclear if there anything else would have progressed or happened if the subject had been allowed to continue. The experiment was ended and the subject destroyed after they drained and killed their own soulmate. This occurred within six months of the first large absorption.

Part of the notes suggest that the subject devolved so quickly because of the short timescale between the large absorptions the experiments entailed. These note suggest that the subject regained some of their lost humanity after exposure to their soulmate. It reportedly took more effort on the soulmate's part each time. It is my theory, that while there is a point of no return for the Unbound, they need not succumb to this fate so easily. An Unbound's soulmate is imperative to their wellbeing, for they will provide an Unbound with a vital tether to humanity.
##### Destroying an Unbound

Please note that the following is completely theoretical and utterly untested. Engaging any Unbound in combat will likely pose unique challenges depending on their individual skillset. If possible I highly advise against duelling with one, particularly if it is in one of the more advanced stages.

In the event an Unbound is too far gone or their soulmate dies, then there is no choice but to destroy them. The difficulty of this task will depend on the how far the Unbound has progressed. From what I have gathered I see no indication that an Unbound is particularly defended against anything but magic. Because of this I would advise employing a muggle approach. An Unbound still requires a beating heart or a head to remain alive. Alternatively if you are able to get close to one without it draining you then you may wish to try feeding it a potent acid, muggles now have several capable of eating through metal, they should do just fine for this. You may also try poison but given a Wizards natural resistance to most muggle poisons and an Unbound's resistance to magic I doubt this would be effective.

Also, should you be worried that you may have no choice but to face one of them in direct combat, I believe ranged weapons would be the best choice.
