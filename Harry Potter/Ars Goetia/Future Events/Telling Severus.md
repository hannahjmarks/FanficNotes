The nerves made my hands shake as I fiddled with the collar covering my soul brand for what must be the hundredth time. The fancy bottle of Brandy I'd found in the remnants of Leviathan's stash sat on top of my trunk next to the finished spell tucked into its envelope. I'd hastily scrawled a letter to accompany it and sealed them together before I could overthink it, again. I'm wearing one of my favourites of the outfit's I had made over summer. It was a tasteful combination. A white blouse just embellished enough to be interesting tucked into a black silk corset and paired with a perfectly tailored pair of black suit trousers. I took one long calming breath before slipping into the knee high leather boots I was quickly getting very attached to and standing to leave.

The dorm room was blessedly empty, my roommates were all in the library working on their various NEWT assignments now that curfew had gone back to normal. Thank Merlin most of my project work had been completed last year. I'd slipped the brandy and the letter into my messenger bag. Explaining what I was doing with alcohol and a letter to my Potions Professor wasn't something I was looking to add to today. I've waited long enough for this and Sirius Bloody Black had already delayed me by a day.

It was just past nine in the evening by the time I reached Severus' office. His office hours should be over now but I cut it as close to curfew as I dared anyway. There was light coming from beneath the door and I can just about hear the faint noises of a cauldron brewing behind the thick wood. I knocked with much more confidence than I felt. The door swung open almost immediately, revealing the tall, lithe frame of my soulmate. Severus' dark circles were particularly pronounced, he didn't look like he'd slept in days. He'd even shed his outer robes, leaving him in just a shirt and trousers. I could just the the top of his soul brand taunting me from his collar. Perhaps this wasn't the time. He clearly had other things going on and I shouldn't add to his plate. I was just about to make up an excuse for my late visit when he spoke. "Miss Avery, our office hours aren't until tomorrow are they?"

"They aren't but I have something to tell you. It can't wait." My heart was racing, sending nervous jitters through my limbs. Severus stood aside and I swept into the office before I could chicken out. He looked thoroughly confused now as he patiently waited for me to elaborate. I lent against the desk forcing my fingers to stay still despite their growing need to sink my claws into the wood.

"Firstly, I don't think this is a conversation you want others to hear." I said, casting several iterations of the Imperturbable Charm on the door and the surrounding walls until I could barely see past my own enchantments. "Secondly, you may need this." This time I pulled the brandy out from my bag, setting it on the desk next to me.

Severus sent me another confused look before locking the door and turning to me. "Well, you have my full attention. Now what is it that has you so worked up that you're bribing a professor with alcohol and gouging my desk?"

I instantly whipped my claws from the divot they'd made. "I- Um- It may be easier if I just showed you." I pulled my collar down on the left side of my neck.

Severus' eyes flew wide at the sight of my soul brand, his hand coming up to where I knew his to be.
