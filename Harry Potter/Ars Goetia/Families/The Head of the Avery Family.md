Timeline:

- [[Belial Avery]]
- [[Leviathan Avery]]
- [[Josephina Avery (n√©e Flint)]]
- [[Dantalion Avery]]

The position can be passed due to:
- The death of the current family head in which case the position will pass to the eldest living descendant or in cases where there are no living descendants it will pass the the eldest sibling of the deceased head
- The current head stepping down from the position in which case it will be passed to either the eldest living descendant or a person chosen by the current head
	- If passing the position to someone other than the eldest living descendant then the current head must name their successor and complete all required legal documentation prior to stepping down.
	- This can only be done by the family head not an acting head
- The current head is determined to be of insufficient mental capacity via a vote of all other blood members of [[The Avery Family]] in which case the position of head can only be passed to the eldest descendant who both bares the Avery name and is of sufficient mental capacity
- The current head is determined to be unfit via a vote of no confidence which shall include all other blood members of [[The Avery Family]] in which case a secondary vote is held to determine the next head.
	- If a vote of no confidence is successful then another cannot be held until 1 year has passed since the installation of a new head
- A vote of any kind can only be called by a full blooded Avery who also bares the name

In cases where the eldest living descendant is underage:
- The child's legal guardian will become the acting head if the guardian bares the Avery name, if not then the child's closest Avery relative will become the acting head
	- The acting head position will cease the instant the true head comes of age. (Dantalion assumes that this means she will need Josephina until she reaches 17 after discovering what Torsten is doing)

Dantalion's observations:
- It is never stated that women cannot inherit
- The term 'blood members of [[The Avery Family]]' will likely include the entire [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] at this point so the votes would be a free for all


Differences between the master and admin catalogues:
- The admin catalogue contains the name of the current family head or acting head and an overview of the above rules 
- The master catalogue contains the full rules and caveats as well as the full list of previous family heads
