- One of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]
- Ancestral home is known as [[The Atelier]]
- Also own a townhouse in Southwark
- Surviving members: [[Josephina Avery (n√©e Flint)]], [[Leviathan Avery]], [[Dantalion Avery]]
- House elf: [[Vissey]]
- Hogwarts Houses: Averys have historically tended towards [[Ravenclaw]] and [[Slytherin]] with the occasional [[Hufflepuff]] but in recent generations there has been a tendency towards Slytherin which coincided with the family's shift into more extreme political views.

**Canon**
- Little is mentioned about the Avery Family
- Avery Snr ([[Belial Avery]]) was part of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s inner circle whilst in school
- Avery Jnr ([[Leviathan Avery]]) was friends with [[Severus Snape]] whilst attending Hogwarts (same year)

**History**
- The Avery family is one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] pureblood families and can track their lineage to the 14th century

- Members of the Avery family were usually artisans but in recent generations were socialites/[[Death Eaters]]

- Members of the Avery family are traditionally named after muggle Demons since [[Rycher Avery]] was mistaken for a demon by a muggle priest and found the ensuing panic so entertaining that he began the convention towards the beginning of the 17th century.

**Wealth**
- The wealth of the Avery Family was gained through various patents for Charms and Potions
- [[Gremory Avery]] only produced a single patent in his lifetime and it was so unsuccessful that it was barely mentioned in any recorded family history and never named.
- [[Belial Avery]] was the first in the Avery family to produce no patents at all and instead chose to live off of the existing Avery fortune. He even gifted some of the patents within the Avery catalogue to [[Lord Voldemort]]
- [[Leviathan Avery]] continued similarly to his father and only took from the Avery fortune
- [[Leviathan Avery]] frequently tried to emulate and compete with [[Lucius Malfoy]] and thus began irresponsibly depleting the Avery fortune by buying dark magic artefacts, clothes, jewels and hosting lavish parties. Gambling frequently occurred at these parties.

**Physical Characteristics**
- Pale glass green eyes
- Tall in stature

- Averys have historically boasted very sharp features and in some cases claws. These features resulted in [[Rycher Avery]] being mistaken for a demon and began the current naming convention.
- This is claimed to be due to having a [[Male Veela]] in their lineage. This is met with significant disbelief in the magical community as the claim was made by [[Cressida Avery]] following the birth of [[Antonius Avery]] in the 15th century, the babe bore no resemblance to her or her husband.
	- As Antonius was the first to show the now characteristic overly sharp features and claws (there are also some accounts stating he had fangs) it is believed that there is likely some truth to Cressida's story in that Antonius' father was likely not human and definitely not her husband.
	- The family line was supposed to continue down her brother [[Oswyn Avery]]'s line but he, and his 2 children all died under mysterious circumstances.
		- They did not all die at the same time. Oswyn was found in his bed (by his wife) with engorged, blackened veins and grey skin, with their mouths open wide as through screaming, their eyes were gone and a black ichor-like substance was around their eye sockets and running down their cheeks like tears.
		- The fact that these deaths were all within the same family
