[[Dantalion Avery]]'s Grandmother. A woman with a significant focus on what is 'proper' and with maintaining appearances (both physical and social). She is the only maternal figure in Dantalion's life and is often manipulative.

**Appearance
- Fair skin
- Features appeared regal in her youth but are becoming more austere with each year
- Heavily greying dark brown hair, straight and usually in some kind of updo
- Tall
- Thin frame

**Temperament prior to [[Leviathan Avery]]'s Death:
- Strict
- Authoritative
- Manipulative
- Sexist (patriarchal)

**Temperament after [[Leviathan Avery]]'s Death:
- Disassociates frequently
- 'A shell of her former self'
- Prone to angry outbursts in her lucid periods, hair trigger 


**Prior to [[Leviathan Avery]]'s Death
- Oversaw raising [[Dantalion Avery]]
	- frequently told Dantalion that it was her duty to grow into 'an exemplary example of a proper pure-blood witch' and that it was 'the least you(she) can do' implying that it was her fault that she was born female.
	- Put an emphasis on etiquette lessons and treated any academic studies as only partly necessary in order to attract a husband from a good family
	- Taught family history extensively but focused on accomplishments of [[The Avery Family]] rather than the rules of succession
	- began lessons when [[Dantalion Avery]] was 4
- Socialite
	- enjoyed more respectable circles than her son
	- frequently referred to Dantalion being 'pretty as a little China doll' in thinly veiled attempts to promote her as an excellent marriage candidate
		- This way of thinking is only popular within [[Josephina Avery (n√©e Flint)]]'s generation as most families will not entertain arranged marriages for their children until they reach maturity and have determined whether a soul mark will appear or not.

**After [[Leviathan Avery]]'s death:
- Became a recluse
	- Spends most days in her rooms and only occasionally moves to her Solar within [[The Atelier]]
	- Usually just sits and stares into space (catatonic)
	- Her physical appearance began to suffer as [[Weekey]] often had trouble getting her to eat
