Sarah was above average in most subjects but did not particularly excel at any either. She was definitely more interested in the social aspects of education over the academic.


Death and Reincarnation:
- Fell from a 4th storey window whilst at a party
	- had been drinking enough to impede her balance/coordination but not her memory
	- Hit her head and died on impact
- Reincarnated into the body of Vephar Avery who had technically died just moments prior 
	- Was deeply affected/traumatised by both her reincarnation/death and her subsequent time trapped as an infant
	- Became increasingly unhinged after her 2nd death and immediate possession of Dantalion

Possessing [[Dantalion Avery]]: 
- possesses when Dantalion is 2 immediately after Vephar dies
- provides constant commentary and chatter until Dantalion is age __
- works with Dani to try and find a new body for her to inhabit
	- gradually looses heart as it becomes clear that this wouldn't be possible in the way she wants
- gradually learns how to use occlumency/legilimency to attempt to fully take over Dani
