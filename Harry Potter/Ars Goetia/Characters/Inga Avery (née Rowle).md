**Marriage to [[Leviathan Avery]]:
- Left Hogwarts after completing her [[O.W.Ls]]  - would have liked to have completed her [[N.E.W.Ts]] but went along with her fathers wishes
- Married Leviathan a few months after leaving Hogwarts
- Became pregnant with [[Dantalion Avery]] after around 6 months of marriage
- Pregnancy and childbirth were hard on her body
- Became pregnant with her second child [[Vephar Avery]] 2 months after giving birth to Dantalion and gave birth on 16th October 1977
- Having 2 difficult pregnancies back to back put a strain on her health and she was bedridden for a further 3 months
- Began to slowly recuperate and resume her hobby of collecting and caring for dangerous magical creatures
- Managed to purchase a [[Peruvian Vipertooth]] egg from the black market which hatched in July 1978
- She was bitten by the hatchling due to over-confidence and lack of proper safety equipment
- She contracted Dragon Pox and passed it to [[Vephar Avery]] via breastmilk both had succumbed to the disease by December 1978. Dantalion was spared this fate as [[Josephina Avery (n√©e Flint)]] insisted she be weaned as early as possible 'so as to not foster weakness'.
	- Josephina will later use this fact to guilt Dantalion.
- Her death should have been preventable but she continued to care for the hatchling after initially infected and only stopped when she was bedridden.
	- she was bitten repeatedly which caused the infection to worsen each time and rendered the treatment from St. Mungo's ineffective due to repeated re-infection.
