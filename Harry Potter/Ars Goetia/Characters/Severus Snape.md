#### Early life/first wizarding war

- Largely canon compliant
- Still falls for Lily
	- Still gets bullied by the marauders
- In fifth year he showed lily his soul brand when she'd asked if he had one
	- He thought she would one day manifest the pair to his own but she then showed him hers, which was by her collar bone and looked nothing like his.
	- This left severus heartbroken but didn't immediately turn him to the death eaters
- Severus never calls lily a mudblood
	- he would have but in the altercation with James Potter he tears a part of his shirt, revealing that James has the pair to Lily's soul brand
	- This devastates severus and damages their friendship
		- They don't really talk or hang out for the rest of their time at hogwarts
- That summer his father is particularly abusive to him
	- His mother doesn't protect him and stops Severus from retaliating against his father
	- This leads Severus to seek refuge with Lucius Malfoy, who had invited him to spend the summer at Malfoy manor anyway
		- Severus had initially declined given who else would be there
	- This is when Severus is indoctrinated into the death eaters
		- he was valued for his skill and intelligence in a way he never had been before, even by lily 
		- he was also finally told that his anger towards his father was justified and that muggles like him and petunia were the norm
			- the evans parents weren't nasty to him but they definitely found him a little creepy and were cold
- Slight deviation when swearing loyalty to dumbledore
	- instead of romantic love for lily being the motivator its a combination of guilt and platonic affection for her
	- Dumbledore still makes him make an unbreakable vow
		- wording is ambiguous enough that it's not actually enforceable
			- Dumbledore knows this, he doesn't want to risk a valuable spy dropping dead and it was more to see if severus was willing to make one
- is still one of the first to find the potters but instead of being heartbroken he's racked with guilt



#### Pre Dani Hogwarts
- Canon compliant
- Believes that his soulmate was probably among the many who died during the war or that he is one of the few who got unlucky and will simply never find them
- Gets exasperated with the students often but its mostly because of the stress of keeping them from blowing themselves and others up in his classroom
	- He mostly has a problem with dealing with the effects of peoples shitty parenting, the kids he knows can't help not knowing things
