The Special Development Agreement was made between [[The Ministry of Magic]] and [[The Avery Family]] in the early 18th century as the result of a governmental push towards free public healthcare and to tackle the disparity between the education levels of healers at the time.

Terms:
- The Averys release all patents for healing spells and potions in exchange for the sum of 500 Galleons.
- The Averys agree to send one member of the Ministry's choosing to aid in the teaching of healers for a period of 2 years, the position will receive a salary of 4 Galleons per month.
- The Averys agree that any improvements made to any of the spells or potions included within this agreement be given to the Ministry in exchange for a flat sum to be determined on a case by case basis, the improved potion or spell will not be patented.
- The Averys agree that any spells or potions of which the primary application falls under healing shall be given to the Ministry in exchange for a flat sum to be determined on a case by case basis, in addition the spell or potion will not be patented by any member of [[The Avery Family]].
- In addition to the above the Ministry grants the Averys special permission to utilise dark or restricted magics during the development of new spells and potions so long as the Averys take due care and attention so as to not endanger others.

The above terms and brief explanation can be found in both the master and administration copies of [[The Avery Catalogue]] however the master catalogue also contains the full explanation and caveats to the agreement i.e. the complete copy which details the parameters and a full explanation of certain phrases e.g. what due care and attention actually means in practice.
