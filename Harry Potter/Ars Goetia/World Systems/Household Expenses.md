Generally household expenses are determined by the competency of the household in things like charms and transfiguration as well as D.A.D.A in some cases as this means that there is no need to pay someone else to do the work. This is limited by the amount of work e.g. large homes require more etc.

General living expenses include food, water, firewood/heat and candles/light
