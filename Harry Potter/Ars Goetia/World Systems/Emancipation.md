"A witch or wizard between the ages of 14 and 17 can if they so chose apply to be legally emancipated from their parents or guardian"


"For an application to be successful the applicant will need to prove to a ministry approved neutral third-party (who will act as the Sponsor of the application) that they:

A) Are fully aware of the ramifications of their request in that their parents/guardian will no longer be responsible for their wellbeing or care and that they will legally have come of age

B) Have secured a safe and suitable place to live

C) Have an income, lump sum or assets substantial enough to sustain their expenses or can provide evidence that they have some stable system to ensure their needs are met

D) Have an understanding that as they will be legally of age that they will therefore be treated as an adult if found participating in any illegal activity 


Dantalion becomes aware of this due to Constantin whose father works in the department of magical law enforcement

She approaches Lucius Malfoy to be her sponsor in exchange for Leviathans entire collection of magical artefacts. Lucius asks her why she isn't asking one of her teachers to fill the role and she answers that firstly they would all likely refuse full emancipation and instead offer to help her apply for a transfer of guardianship instead and secondly she would still be stuck with an entire room stuffed with very illegal dark magic artefacts that Leviathan had probably shown to at least half of all the men in the sacred twenty-eight

When challenged by the ministry worker about Lucius' impartiality and the subsequent offer to have another ministry worker sponsor instead she responds by stating that as the ministry would benefit from her application being rejected as it would mean that the patents for both the Specialis Revelio charm and the Antidote to Veritaserum would run out as Josephina was not in a fit enough state to renew them.
