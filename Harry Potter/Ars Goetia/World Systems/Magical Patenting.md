- Can be applied to charms/spells although it would still need to be incorporated into a physical product
	- The use of patented spells or potions either independently or in the products of an organisation which does not own the patents means that they would need to have a licensing agreement with the patent holder 
- Potions are far easier to patent
- It is only possible to patent for commercial use not private
