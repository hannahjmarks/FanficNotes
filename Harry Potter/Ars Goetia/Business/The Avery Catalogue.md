==**[[The Head of the Avery Family]] holds the highest level of authority over all patents in the catalogue. Only [[The Head of the Avery Family]] can sign off any transfers or sales of patents and all licensing agreements must bare the signature of [[The Head of the Avery Family]] at the time.==

A list of all the active patents registered to [[The Avery Family]] takes the physical form of a large official looking ledger. It is linked to the records within the [[Magical Patenting]] office within [[The Ministry of Magic]].

- The master catalogue was kept (and rediscovered by [[Dantalion Avery]]) in the workshop in the basement of [[The Atelier]]
	- The master catalogue contained not only a list of all patents ever filed by [[The Avery Family]] it was also where all the development note were stored and organised
	- It also shows the all the historical data of any patent filed by [[The Avery Family]] even if transferred to another owner or allowed to expire
	- Can be searched by verbally asking a question
	- Due to the sensitive information contained within the master catalogue is both charmed to appear uninteresting and unhelpful. If someone outside of the Avery family were to persist the letters within the catalogue would rearrange themselves into gibberish
	- Individuals outside the Avery bloodline can also be keyed into the catalogue using both their and their soulmate's completed soul marks
	- Includes all licensing agreements, both active and historical
	- [[The Head of the Avery Family]] will automatically gain full access to the master catalogue when they receive the position
	- It cannot be removed from [[The Atelier]] by anyone other than [[The Head of the Avery Family]]
- The administration catalogue was kept in [[Leviathan Avery]]'s study and was frequently perused by [[Torsten Rowle]] whilst he was tricking [[Josephina Avery (n√©e Flint)]] into transferring as many of [[The Avery Family]]'s assets to himself
	- Whilst it can be read by those outside [[The Avery Family]] it does not contain any information other than the status of all the patents currently held by [[The Avery Family]] 
	- It cannot be removed from [[The Atelier]] unless removed from the grounds by a member of [[The Avery Family]]
	- Any patents allowed to expire or transferred to a new owner will disappear from the administration catalogue after 1 week. This gave [[Torsten Rowle]] the impression that he would have enough time to take all [[The Avery Family]]'s wealth and income before anyone noticed
	- Appearance was similar to the master catalogue but not as thick and slightly less ornate

| Unbreakable Charm      | Was easy enough to perform that no royalties were gained as consumers were simply enchanting their own items  or having a friend do it for them rather than paying extra for the pre-enchanted items or enchanting services                                                                                                                     |
| Eradication Spell      | Whilst originally intended to prevent corporate espionage the spell quickly became a favourite of criminals and thus [[The Avery Family]] chose to disassociate themselves as much as possible                                                                                                                                                  |
| Muggle Repelling Charm | Whilst a few Averys were credited with involvement in the creation of the Muggle Repelling Charm they were a part of a larger international team. The creation of the Muggle Repelling Charm was one of the first endeavours of its kind and was a direct result of the establishment of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692 |

[[The Special Development Agreement]] overview
- The Avery family also developed a number of healing spells and potions all of which were immediately patented
- [[The Ministry of Magic]] brokered a deal with [[The Avery Family]] that in exchange for releasing those patents they would receive various benefits and special permissions from the Ministry.


Patent renewal:
- Infrequent but is better handled by a lawyer with a firm understanding of patent law in order to file a renewal without issues
- As the number of patents had decreased by [[Leviathan Avery]]'s stewardship and none were imminently up for renewal he did not bother to find a new lawyer after the death of the previous wizard they had on retainer in the [[First Wizarding War]]
