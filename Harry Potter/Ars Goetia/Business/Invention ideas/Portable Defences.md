- Dani builds on the work of her great great grandmother
- Dani learns everything she can about persistent enchantments from flitwick, McGonagall and snape
- Dani eventually gets the idea to enchant a portable device that would emit these protections in a given area when activated and would remain active until turned off
	- this would require a key of sorts
- Dani creates such a device by summer in her fifth year which she presents to the ministry as proof that she's capable of fulfilling the contract
	- the ministry is extremely interested in the portable version as well, noting how useful it could be to aurors when they need to secure areas when out in the field
	- Gringotts also get wind of it and want to negotiate their own contract for them for their curse-breaking division
- This is the primary source of income for the family
- The ministry was close to using another provider for the security until dani proves that she can do it.
