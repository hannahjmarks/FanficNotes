- Similar to the normal floo network but for letter and parcel delivery
- a smaller fireplace or similar receptacle could be added to a home and connected to an object specific floo network
- would require fireproof paper/packing materials and firesafe ink
- some households would have fancier ones than others
	- one that could accommodate larger parcels, alert people when something arrived or had a designated address book of sorts so that the user didn't need to say a long address every time they sent something
- Would make owls less critical to wizarding communication
- each fireplace would be identified with a unique address and it would be possible for a single building to have more than one, i.e. a public and private one in shops




- Dani could develop it to help the order communicate in later years
	- Dani could develop a portable one very easily but if one were to fall into the hands of voldemort's followers then they would be receiving all the letters intended for the order member it belonged too
- She is able to develop it because of [[The Special Development Agreement]] but it alerts the ministry that she's working on something of that nature leading to voldemort finding out
	- Voldemort demands a demonstration of them and wants Dani to supply his inner circle with them
		- Dani makes an additional fireplace which she gives to the order, all the other fireplaces on voldemort's closed network have a gemino curse hidden in their enchantments which sends a copy of the correspondence to the order's secret fireplace
			- Specifically Dani gives it to dumbledor who leaves it to moody after his death
