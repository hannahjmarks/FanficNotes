Uncommon

A soul mark appears as a runic symbol on the skin which looks somewhat like a faded scar in colour but with defined edges and a distinctive almost iridescent sheen 

Acquisition:
A soul mark may appear when an individual's magical core reaches maturity(1) usually around the age of 17

Lore:

- Soulmates have matching soul marks in identical locations
- Soulmates will be able to distinguish each other as when they see each others mark it's sheen will turn golden. This will only happen once both parties have seen the others mark.
- To discover one another one or both soulmates will feel their soul mark flare in their mate's vicinity. The sensation differs but has been described as electricity, a pulse or in rare cases burning.
- Soulmates are usually of similar ages but there have been many documented cases of age gaps exceeding 7 years with the largest age gap ever recorded being 43 years however this is widely disputed as it reportedly occurred in the 19th century when it was improper to show even completed soul marks publicly and was between a 14 year old witch and her father's 57 year old business partner.

- It is considered uncouth to openly display a soul mark before finding your soulmate
- Soul marks are known to heighten the bearers current positive emotions when touched by their mate

- It is rare for witches or wizards considered powerful to not receive soul marks(2)
- It is theorised that Merlin received a soul mark at birth making him by far the youngest in history

- People have tried to fake soul marks in the past in order to arrange marriages
- Pureblood families have been known to falsely announce that their children had received a soul mark in order to make them seem more powerful and to arrange marriages between families. This involved planting fake matching soul marks on both children.
- It is now illegal to fake a soul mark. The punishment can vary but has a minimum sentence of 2 months in Azkaban and a 500 Galleon fine.(3)



(1)Dantalion will revise this theory privately to "when an individuals core reaches sufficient size"

(2)Dantalion will come to the conclusion that the famous witches/wizards of history who did not receive soul marks were highly skilled but lacked raw power

(3)If the perpetrator is underage at the time of the offense in which case the punishment is limited to community service and possible fine up to a maximum of 700 Galleons to be paid by the wizard or witches family.
