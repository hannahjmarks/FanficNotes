#MagicSystem 

- Any sentient living magical entity has a magical core
- Objects such as wands channel and direct magic but do not possess a core of their own
- Non-sentient magical plants channel the ambient magic around them and as a result they grow better along ley lines



- ==Cores are linked to/a part of the soul==
