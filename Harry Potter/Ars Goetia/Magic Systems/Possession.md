## Normal Possession (<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Non-Canon</mark>)

- 2 Known methods
	- Via [[Legilimency]]
		- Forceful control of another's soul
		- Extremely painful for the victim
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Would kill victim in less than a day</mark>
	- Via an external medium or conduit
		- Longer term
		- Can alter the victim physically (e.g. [[Quirinus Quirrell]])
		- Medium/conduit must be powerful
			- Only known instances were due to unicorn blood and a [[Horcrux]]
			- Possession was stopped by killing the host (Quirrell) in the case of unicorn blood and destroying the medium in the case of the Horcrux
			- In this case the victim does not need to die
			- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Potentially, cutting off Quirrell from the unicorn blood could have ended the hold Voldemort had on him</mark>


## Dantalion's Possession

- Different from all known cases
- Would have killed her within the 1st day if not for her unique core
	- Is slowly killing her and getting worse as she grows
- Sarah is not inherently able to control Dani's body but is able to affect her thoughts and access her memories.
- [[Occlumency]] and [[Legilimency]] are effective between Dani and Sarah
	- This works both ways
