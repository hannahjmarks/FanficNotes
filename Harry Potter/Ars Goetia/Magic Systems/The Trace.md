#MagicSystem

Canon information:

- It is a charm placed on all magical children that automatically breaks when they turn 17
- not specified how the trace is placed on magical students

- "Allows the Ministry to know of magic cast in the vicinity of wizards and witches who were under seventeen years of age. When any magical activity was performed in the vicinity of the underage individual, the Improper Use of Magic Office within the [[The Ministry of Magic]] was alerted to the spell that was used, and to the location of the caster and the time it was cast."

- Wizarding families are trusted to parent/punish their own children with regards to the use of underage magic as the trace picks up any magic used near the child and cannot distinguish the caster
- Children from muggle homes are monitored more closely as it is unlikely that the magic came from someone other than the child

- As Harry was blamed for Dobby's use of magic in chamber of secrets we can infer that the charm is unable to distinguish magic performed by witches/wizards and house elves


My Additions:

- Trace is placed on students during the [[Hogwarts Express]] which explains why students from Scotland have to travel to London to get to school in Scotland and why Hermione was able to perform magic at home before first year
