#Event

- [[Sarah Crowley]]'s soul is released from the body of [[Vephar Avery]] as she dies of dragon pox.
- 2 year old [[Dantalion Avery]] walks into the room as the last thread connecting Sarah's soul to her current body snaps
- In her desperation Sarah latches onto and possesses Dantalion
- As it is not Sarah's ghost that possesses Dantalion but her soul she is far more limited in her abilities


Mechanics:
- not a normal possession as all historical cases of possession occur between a living person and a ghost
	- a ghost is the imprint of a dead witch or wizard's soul not the soul itself
- perhaps closer to the Quirrell situation than normal possession
- Sarah is not able to control Dantalion's body in any way
	- Sarah's mind and soul are attached to Dantalion's but not a part of her
- [[Occlumency]] and [[Legilimency]] are effective between Dani and Sarah
